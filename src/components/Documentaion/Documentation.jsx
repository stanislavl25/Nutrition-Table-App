              Start by going to the products tab of our app and selecting the
              products you want to add information for. You can select a single
              product or edit multiple products at the same time in bulk action.
              Here you can filter by products and categories and flexibly put
              together the selection of your products that you want to edit. Of
              course you can also select and edit all products.

              Once you have selected one or more products, the 'Create Label'
              button will take you to the page where you can add and edit the
              information for this/these product/s. Depending on your country
              and pricing plan, you have various options for selecting and
              entering nutritional information. For help, click on the small
              tooltips next to the input fields. You can recognize them by the
              small ‚Äòi‚Äô symbols.

              In some countries, however, food laws allow the nutritional
              information to be related to the prepared food, provided that

              Both options for nutritional labeling are therefore permissible.
              In the second variant, however, the supplier must describe the
              preparation in sufficient detail. So he has to state how much
              water or other ingredients should be added, if necessary, and
              whether the food needs to be boiled or baked, for example - and if
              so, for how long.

                The Nutri-Score uses a 5-level color scale from A to E to
                provide information about the nutritional value of a food. The
                green A stands for a more favorable, the red E for a less
                favorable nutritional value of the respective product and
                enables comparisons within the respective product group. The
                Nutri-Score is therefore a useful supplement to the information
                required by law, such as a list of ingredients and a nutritional
                value table.

                The Nutri-Score can currently be used on a voluntary basis in
                Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Other EU
                countries such as the Netherlands and Spain are also planning to
